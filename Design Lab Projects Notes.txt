Bubble Game Notes
o save high score
o add difficulties

Canvas:
o add toolbar:
	o color picker will be one icon with dropdown
	o custom color selector
	o eraser (just changes bg color to lightgray)
	o toggle canvas box borders

Scroll animation:
o make animation that progresses as you scroll

Future: navbar tests:
o just try to get the process down

Future: shape creator:
o user enters specs in input fields such as height, width, border radius, etc.
o can select certain preset things such as shape (square, circle, etc.)
o when all is input, hit enter to generate shape

Future: dodging game:
o desc: 5 tracks (rows) and character sits at left; items to avoid slide from right to left and you dodge them by using arrow keys to move up and down tracks
o can have good items that give bonus points or maybe effects like temporarily slowing down movement of bad items
o no time limit; instead, make it progressively harder over time
	o this could be done by making bad item speed/frequency increase ever so slightly after each one is deployed. That way, js is not relying on time intervals to increase difficulty or end game
